                            <p>Diabetes is a chronic (long-lasting) health condition that affects how your 
                                body turns food into energy.
                            </p>
                            <p>Most of the food you eat is broken down into sugar (also called glucose) and 
                                released into your bloodstream. When your blood sugar goes up, it signals your 
                                pancreas to release insulin. Insulin acts like a key to let the blood sugar into 
                                your body's cells for use as energy.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                If you have diabetes, your body either doesn't make enough insulin or can't use 
                                the insulin it makes as well as it should. When there isn't enough insulin or cells 
                                stop responding to insulin, too much blood sugar stays in your bloodstream. Over time, 
                                that can cause serious health problems, such as heart disease, vision loss, and kidney 
                                disease.
                            </p>
                            <p>
                                There isn't a cure yet for diabetes, but losing weight, eating healthy food, and being active 
                                can really help. Taking medicine as needed, getting diabetes self-management education and support, 
                                and keeping health care appointments can also reduce the impact of diabetes on your life.

                            There are three main types of diabetes:

                        <p>Type 1 diabetes is thought to be caused by an autoimmune reaction (the body attacks itself by mistake) that 
                            stops your body from making insulin. Approximately 5-10% of the people who have diabetes have type 1. Symptoms 
                            of type 1 diabetes often develop quickly. It's usually diagnosed in children, teens, and young adults. If you 
                            have type 1 diabetes, you'll need to take insulin every day to survive. Currently, no one knows how to prevent 
                            type 1 diabetes.

                        <p>
                            With type 2 diabetes, your body doesn't use insulin well and can't keep blood sugar at normal levels. About 
                            90-95% of people with diabetes have type 2. It develops over many years and is usually diagnosed in adults 
                            (but more and more in children, teens, and young adults). You may not notice any symptoms, so it's important to 
                            get your blood sugar tested if you're at risk. Type 2 diabetes can be prevented or delayed with healthy lifestyle 
                            changes, such as losing weight, eating healthy food, and being active.

                        <p>
                            Gestational diabetes develops in pregnant women who have never had diabetes. If you have gestational diabetes, 
                            your baby could be at higher risk for health problems. Gestational diabetes usually goes away after your baby is 
                            born but increases your risk for type 2 diabetes later in life. Your baby is more likely to have obesity as a child 
                            or teen, and more likely to develop type 2 diabetes later in life too.
